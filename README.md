# KOBE Gamemode

A gamemode for Garry's Mod where you push a ball to a zone to then throw into a basket or goal.

## Installation
To install this gamemode, put all of these files into `GarrysMod/garrysmod/gamemodes/kobe` folder.

Might put this on Workshop in a while, but I'm not even close to done yet.
